# serverless-slackbot

Create webhooks and slash commands for your Slack team without servers.

In your Serverless project root directory, run:

```
sls module install https://github.com/serverless/serverless-slackbot
```


## Creating Slash Commands

Once you install the module, a simple slash command webhook is created for you. If you open up `<module-dir>/slashcommands/s-function.json` you'll find all the information you need about the webhook.
